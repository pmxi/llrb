Visualizer starts at the first execution step after performing an operation.
This is unintuitive because the user expects to see the outcome of the operation immediately.

steps to reproduce:
1. load visualizer in browser.
2. insert(1)
3. We will not see a 1 in the visualization. Unintended behavior.
